# AlgoMate - organization specific assistance

AlgoMate is a VS Code extension that enhances Algorand smart contract development with AI-powered assistance. It helps developers create, edit, and deploy smart contracts more efficiently on the Algorand blockchain. We are offering two versions of our extension : 
- LLM based (ideal for small users since the call is made through API)
- SLM based (ideal for organizations wanting full privacy over model calls)

## ‚ú® Features

### Smart Contract Generation
- **Purpose-based Templates**: Generate contracts for various use cases:
  - Escrow
  - NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens)
  - DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
  - DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
  - Voting systems
  - And more...

### Contract Types
- Support for different Algorand contract types:
  - Stateful contracts
  - Stateless contracts
  - Signature-based contracts

### Development Tools
- **AI-Powered Code Completion**: Get intelligent code suggestions as you type
- **Inline Documentation**: Automatic generation of docstrings and documentation
- **Code Improvement Suggestions**: AI-powered code optimization recommendations

### Difference from other AI
- No Hallucinations due to RAG
- Cosine Similarity to log down relevent examples from the community
- Can be modified to have LLM as a fallback for SLM
- Retry option with prompt and code passed as context
- Direct Deployment options

### Supported Languages
- Primary language: Python (PyTeal)
- Clean and readable code generation

## üöÄ Getting Started
