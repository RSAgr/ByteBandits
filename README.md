## 🏆 Algorand Competition Submission

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Algorand development requires deep understanding of blockchain concepts, PyTeal/TEAL syntax, and smart contract patterns. This creates a steep learning curve for new developers and slows down experienced ones.

### 🚀 Our Solution
ByteBandits integrates directly into VS Code to provide:
- **AI-Powered Development**: Context-aware code generation and completion
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Generate complete contracts from simple descriptions
- **Education**: Learn Algorand development through interactive guidance
- **Best Practices**: Built-in security and optimization recommendations

## 🛠 Installation

### Prerequisites
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (v1.85 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or later)
- [Algorand Node](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/) (for local development)

### Quick Start
1. Install the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Search for "ByteBandits: Initialize Workspace"
4. Follow the setup wizard to configure your environment

## 🎬 Usage

1. **Generate New Contract**
   - Open Command Palette
   - Search for "ByteBandits: New Contract"
   - Select contract type and parameters
   - Let AI generate the base contract

2. **Get AI Assistance**
   - Type `//` or `"""` for docstring generation
